THIS IS A FORK OF AIRBNB STYLE GUIDE

The [original] doesn't get much maintenance these days and doesn't support the
big changes in ESLint 9.0.0, so this is mainly just for the sake of updating the
peer dependencies on the base rules and trimming the fat (e.g., Babel).

See the adjacent directories, `eslint-config-airbnb-base` in particular, for
more information on their structure and configuration.
